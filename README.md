Ren-HP
========

The Ren Hypertext Preprocessor

Much better than crappy PHP

Reasons For the Project
-----------------------

If you've read "PHP a Fractal of Bad Design", then you'll understand.  PHP is a mess, Rebol is light-years better designed but currrently lack some feature due to being in development (Thank you HostileFork for resurrecting the project).  The general idea is that this will be a more performant and safe drop in replacement for the current usage of Rebol3 as standard CGI.  Similar to Rebol Server Pages, it intends to be a superset of functionality built on top the Ren-C (Rebol 3 Core) library and the Ren-CPP bridge/runtime with built in support for the Lest templating engine, style talk and other useful components geared towards server-side web-development.

Rebol is a very powerful language wich allows for the leveraging and bending of language to perform feats unthinkable in many programming languages.  Join us in building the future of computing :)
